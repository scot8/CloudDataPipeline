# Cloud Data Pipeline for Real-Time Insights

This project implements a cloud-based data pipeline using **Azure Synapse Analytics** and **PolyBase** to query and analyze external data stored in **Azure Blob Storage**. The pipeline enables efficient querying and real-time insights without requiring data movement into the database, leveraging the power of external tables and T-SQL for data transformation and analysis.

## Project Overview

### Objective
- Design a scalable, secure, and cost-effective data pipeline to analyze external sales data stored in Azure Blob Storage.
- Use Azure Synapse Analytics and PolyBase to define external data sources, file formats, and external tables for querying external data directly.

### Features
- Seamless integration with **Azure Blob Storage** using external data sources.
- On-the-fly querying of external data using **PolyBase**, reducing data transfer overhead.
- Transformation and aggregation of sales data using **T-SQL scripts**.
- Secure data handling with role-based access controls (RBAC) and best practices.

---

## Architecture

1. **Data Source**: Azure Blob Storage stores the external CSV file containing raw sales data.
2. **Azure Synapse Analytics**: External tables query the data without importing it into the database.
3. **PolyBase**: Acts as the bridge between the external data and the Synapse SQL environment, enabling seamless querying.
4. **T-SQL**: Used for defining the external data pipeline and performing transformations.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Synapse Analytics**
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **PolyBase**
- **T-SQL**

---

## File Descriptions

### `create_external_data_source.sql`
SQL script to create the external data source pointing to the Azure Blob Storage container.

### `create_file_format.sql`
SQL script to define the external file format for the delimited text file (CSV).

### `create_external_table.sql`
SQL script to create an external table representing the data stored in the CSV file.

### `query_data.sql`
Sample T-SQL queries to analyze and transform the data in the external table.

---

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have access to Azure services.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Set up a Blob Storage account and container with the CSV file uploaded.
- **Azure Synapse Workspace**: Create a Synapse Analytics workspace.

### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Upload Data to Blob Storage**:
   - Upload the `business.retailsales2.csv` file to an Azure Blob Storage container (e.g., `container1`).

2. **Create External Data Source**:
   - Run the `create_external_data_source.sql` script to define the Blob Storage as an external data source in Synapse.

3. **Define File Format**:
   - Execute the `create_file_format.sql` script to define the structure of the CSV file (delimited text format).

4. **Create External Table**:
   - Execute the `create_external_table.sql` script to create an external table pointing to the CSV file in Blob Storage.

5. **Query the Data**:
   - Use the `query_data.sql` script to query and analyze the data in the external table.

## Example Queries

### Sample Query: Get Total Sales by Year
```sql
SELECT Year, SUM(TotalSales) AS TotalSales
FROM business_report
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year;
```

### Sample Query: Top 5 Months by Total Sales
```sql
SELECT Month, Year, TotalSales
FROM business_report
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

## Results and Outcomes

- Enabled real-time querying of external sales data without data movement.
- Optimized data handling by leveraging external tables and PolyBase.
- Built a cost-effective and scalable solution for analyzing sales data in a cloud environment.

---

## Security and Best Practices

- Configured **RBAC** to restrict access to Azure Synapse and Blob Storage.
- Implemented **firewall rules** to limit access to trusted IPs and networks.
- Followed Azure cost optimization strategies for storage and compute.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with **Power BI** for real-time data visualization.
- Expand the pipeline to include multiple data sources.
- Automate data loading and table creation using Azure Data Factory.
